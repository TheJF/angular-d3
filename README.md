# AngularJS-D3 Module

A set of AngularJS directives that provides a declarative syntax for building
common charts using D3.

## Project Goals

This provides an AngularJS module called `ad3` which in turn provides a
declarative HTML syntax for using D3 with AngularJS. The syntax has been
inspired in part by [this blog post][radian] however since that project is not
currently open source I've begun work on building my own.

The first goal of this project is to create a simple reusable set of D3
directives that are sufficiently complete to be able to put together flexible
charts of nearly any type. It is also intended to be extensible by providing a
d3ChartController similar to ngModelController so it is easy to create
additional custom chart elements.

This project is meant to provide enough flexibility to allow for anything d3 is
capable of with no limitations, but still provide convenience, re-usability and
declarative functionality. Essentially creating simple graphs should be simple
yet doing complex customizable things should be possible.

## Current Directives

- d3-chart - Provides the top level directives meant to contain the rest of the
  chart declarations.
- d3-data - Provides a declarative way to load data into the current scope
  directly from a URL
- d3-axis - Defines an axis and provide it's range and location (top, left,
  bottom, right)
- d3-area - Define an area graph
- d3-line - Defines a line graph
- d3-bars - Defines a set of bars for a bar chart

The directives are meant to be used to compose charts like so:

```html
  <d3-data src="data/data.csv" data="line" columns="year, savings, total, optimal"></d3-data>
  <d3-data src="data/donutData.csv" data="pie" columns="age,population"></d3-data>
  <div d3-chart>
    <d3-axis data="line" name="year" label="Year" extent="true" orientation="bottom" ticks="5"></d3-axis>
    <d3-axis data="line" name="savings" label="Deposits" orientation="left" ticks="5"></d3-axis>
    <d3-axis data="line" name="total" label="Savings" orientation="right" ticks="5"></d3-axis>
    <d3-line data="line" x="year" y="optimal" yscale="total"></d3-line>
    <d3-area data="line" x="year" y="total"></d3-area>
    <d3-bars data="line" x="year" y="savings"></d3-bars>
  </div>
```

The `d3-chart` directive will first append `<svg class="d3"><g></g></svg>` to
itself and then each inner directives will attach their own d3 powered elements
to that. The `d3ChartController` provides access to its `<g></g>` element via
`getChart()` so that child directives can append themselves.

The `d3-data` directive provides a way of declaratively binding data, but this
is entirely optional and it simply is a convenient way to bind data to your
current scope.

Documentation will be forthcoming as things develop but for now you will have
to rely on a quick reading of the code.

## Try it out

This project uses Yeoman and provides a fully functional demo project under the
`/app` folder. To run it clone this repo and do:

```
npm install
npm install -g bower
npm install -g grunt

# If you don't already have bower installed then install it with

bower install

grunt server
```

## Feature Roadmap

- [x] Basic chart forms for: Area, Line and Bars
- [x] Supports multiple axis and multiple charts can be stacked
- [x] Dynamically updating charts supporting animations (should be able to
display and track incoming time-series data)
- [x] Data source directives to declaratively specify and load external data
sources and support D3's built in parsers for CSV, TSV, etc.
- [ ] Customizable chart legends
- [ ] Customizable and flexible labels 
- [ ] Mouse and touch overlay support
- [ ] Scatter and Bubble plots
- [ ] Bullet charts
- [ ] Stacked area charts

If you have any other ideas for me, or feel like contributing to help add any
of this missing functionality, I encourage you to submit a pull request.
